# 🎨 Printing Management System - Full Project Overview

## 📌 1. Project Overview
The **Printing Management System** is a **fully automated**, **graphical**, and **priority-driven** print job management system. It efficiently manages multiple **types of printers**, employs a **priority circular queue**, and features a **real-time animated UI** for **visualizing the entire print process**.

### 🌟 Core Features
- **✔ Fully Automated** – Print jobs generate at **random intervals** and are **automatically assigned**.
- **✔ Priority Circular Queue** – Over-engineered **priority-based queue** to ensure **optimized job handling**.
- **✔ Dynamic UI with Animations** – **Printers, queues, and jobs move** in real-time.
- **✔ Real-Time Status Indicators** –
  - 🟢 **Green** = Ready  
  - 🟡 **Yellow** = Busy  
  - 🔴 **Red** = Error
- **✔ Error Handling & Auto-Recovery** – Handles **paper jams, network issues, out of ink**, and more.
- **✔ Live Job Processing** – Jobs move through **Pre-Queue ➔ Printer Queue ➔ Completion**.
- **✔ Logging & History Tracking** – Logs **completed jobs, errors, and system events**.

## 📌 3. Functional Breakdown
### 1️⃣ Print Job Handling
- Print jobs **generate automatically** at **random intervals**.
- Each print job has:
  - **Document Name**
  - **Number of Pages**
  - **Paper Size** (A4, A3, Letter)
  - **Color Mode** (Black & White, Color)
  - **Print Priority** (Urgent, Standard, Low)
- Jobs **first enter a Pre-Queue** before being assigned to a printer.

### 2️⃣ Printer Management
- Supports **multiple printer types**:
  - **Laser Printers** (Fast, high-capacity)
  - **Inkjet Printers** (High-quality color prints)
  - **Label Printers** (Barcode & label printing)
- Printers process jobs in **FIFO order** within their individual **priority queues**.
- If a **high-priority job** enters, it may **skip ahead** in the queue.
- **Live status indicators** show:
  - 🟢 **Green** → Ready (Idle)
  - 🟡 **Yellow** → Busy (Processing)
  - 🔴 **Red** → Error (Paper Jam, Low Ink, etc.)

### 3️⃣ Priority Circular Queue (Over-Engineered Logic)
- **Circular queue design** ensures **efficient memory usage**.
- **Priority-based insertion** ensures **Urgent jobs take precedence**.
- **Aging Mechanism**:
  - Low-priority jobs **gain priority** if they wait too long.
- **Overflow Handling**:
  - If the queue is full, **lowest-priority jobs are dropped** to maintain efficiency.
- **Lock-Free Access** using **atomic operations** for multi-threaded efficiency.

### 4️⃣ Job Dispatching & Processing
- **Pre-Queue ➔ Printer Queue ➔ Printing Process**
- Jobs **move visually** from **pre-queue to printer queue**.
- **Timers track print job durations**.
- **Job completion triggers UI animations**, moving the file to the **completed jobs log**.

### 5️⃣ Real-Time Animated UI
- **🌍 Network Canvas**
  - **Printers appear as nodes**, connected via **lines**.
  - **Jobs move dynamically** to their assigned printer.
- **📊 Queue Visualization**
  - Each printer displays **queue size and job order**.
  - **Icons move from queue to printer** in real-time.
- **📅 Status Panel**
  - Displays **active jobs, printer statuses, and queue states**.
- **⚠️ Error Alerts**
  - Affected printers **flash red**, with the **error appearing in a log panel**.
- **📝 Logging System**
  - Past jobs & errors stored in a **history panel**.

### 6️⃣ 💡 GUI Update - Printer Info Panels
- **👁 Layout Changes**
  - Each **printer has a dedicated panel** in the UI.
  - Panels **dynamically adjust** based on **available printers**.
  - Positioned **below or beside the network canvas**.
- **🎨 Panel Contents**
  - 🖨 **Printer Name (Bold Header)**
  - 🔴 **Status Indicator**
  - 📄 **Queue Size Display**
  - ⏳ **Active Job Progress Bar**
  - ⚠️ **Error Message Area (if applicable)**
- **🔄 Real-Time Updates**
  - Status **updates dynamically**.
  - **Queue count changes** as jobs are processed.
  - **Progress bar** updates based on **job processing time**.

### 7️⃣ Error Handling & Recovery
- **Predefined Errors (5-6 types):**
  - Out of Paper
  - Paper Stuck
  - Network Communication Error
  - Corrupted File
  - Out of Ink (or other consumable)
- **Error Behavior:**
  - Some errors **self-recover** (e.g., **network issue retries**).
  - Others require **user intervention** (e.g., **replace ink, clear jam**).
  - Printer remains **in "Error" state** until the issue is resolved.

### 8️⃣ Logging & History Tracking
- **All job completions and errors are logged**.
- UI displays:
  - **Completed jobs with timestamps**.
  - **Errors with details**.
- **Export option** to **save logs** as a **text file or CSV**.
