#  Printing Management System - Full Project Overview

##  1. Project Overview
The **Printing Management System** is a **fully automated**, **graphical**, and **priority-driven** print job management system. It efficiently manages multiple **types of printers**, employs a **priority circular queue**, and features a **real-time animated UI** for **visualizing the entire print process**.

###  Core Features
- ** Fully Automated** â€“ Print jobs generate at **random intervals** and are **automatically assigned**.
- ** Priority Circular Queue** â€“ Over-engineered **priority-based queue** to ensure **optimized job handling**.
- ** Dynamic UI with Animations** â€“ **Printers, queues, and jobs move** in real-time.
- ** Real-Time Status Indicators** â€“
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** = Ready  
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** = Busy  
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** = Error
- ** Error Handling & Auto-Recovery** â€“ Handles **paper jams, network issues, out of ink**, and more.
- ** Live Job Processing** â€“ Jobs move through **Pre-Queue âž” Printer Queue âž” Completion**.
- ** Logging & History Tracking** â€“ Logs **completed jobs, errors, and system events**.

##  2. System Architecture
The project follows a **layered architecture** to ensure **scalability and modularity**.

##  3. Functional Breakdown
###  Print Job Handling
- Print jobs **generate automatically** at **random intervals**.
- Each print job has:
  - **Document Name**
  - **Number of Pages**
  - **Paper Size** (A4, A3, Letter)
  - **Color Mode** (Black & White, Color)
  - **Print Priority** (Urgent, Standard, Low)
- Jobs **first enter a Pre-Queue** before being assigned to a printer.

###  Printer Management
- Supports **multiple printer types**:
  - **Laser Printers** (Fast, high-capacity)
  - **Inkjet Printers** (High-quality color prints)
  - **Label Printers** (Barcode & label printing)
- Printers process jobs in **FIFO order** within their individual **priority queues**.
- If a **high-priority job** enters, it may **skip ahead** in the queue.
- **Live status indicators** show:
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green** â†’ Ready (Idle)
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow** â†’ Busy (Processing)
  - ðŸ”´ **Red** â†’ Error (Paper Jam, Low Ink, etc.)

###  Priority Circular Queue (Over-Engineered Logic)
- **Circular queue design** ensures **efficient memory usage**.
- **Priority-based insertion** ensures **Urgent jobs take precedence**.
- **Aging Mechanism**:
  - Low-priority jobs **gain priority** if they wait too long.
- **Overflow Handling**:
  - If the queue is full, **lowest-priority jobs are dropped** to maintain efficiency.
- **Lock-Free Access** using **atomic operations** for multi-threaded efficiency.

###  Job Dispatching & Processing
- **Pre-Queue âž” Printer Queue âž” Printing Process**
- Jobs **move visually** from **pre-queue to printer queue**.
- **Timers track print job durations**.
- **Job completion triggers UI animations**, moving the file to the **completed jobs log**.

###  Error Handling & Recovery
- **Predefined Errors (5-6 types):**
  - Out of Paper
  - Paper Stuck
  - Network Communication Error
  - Corrupted File
  - Out of Ink (or other consumable)
- **Error Behavior:**
  - Some errors **self-recover** (e.g., **network issue retries**).
  - Others require **user intervention** (e.g., **replace ink, clear jam**).
  - Printer remains **in "Error" state** until the issue is resolved.

###  Logging & History Tracking
- **All job completions and errors are logged**.
- UI displays:
  - **Completed jobs with timestamps**.
  - **Errors with details**.
- **Export option** to **save logs** as a **text file or CSV**.
